# Demonstrate a Front-End Web Programming Example

## Learning Goals

- Define web programming
- Identify the â€œThree Pillars of Web Programming"

## Introduction

HTML, CSS and JavaScript are the primary tools we use to build the web. To
visualize how they all work together, think about the web as a robot. HTML is
the robot's structure, CSS is the paint on the robot plus how its pieces are
positioned and JavaScript is what actually makes the robot move. So if we want
to build fully formed web applications that accept, change and return
information (in other words, make the robot move), we'll need to add to our own
toolbox an understanding of the Document Object Model (DOM), the JavaScript
lanugage and the principles of web programming.

### Define Web Programming

- define web programming
- describe reference example scenario (social media favorite action)

### Identify the "Three Pillars of Web Programming"

- describe the pillars:
  - manipulating the DOM
  - recognizing JS events
  - communication with the server

## Conclusion

Web programming is how we build ways of information input and output for the
web. We can break down web programming into three pillars that involve working
with the DOM, JavaScript eventing and communication with the server. Now that
we've seen how these elements are connected in principle, we can now move on to
seeing how they work together in practice.
