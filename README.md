# Demonstrate a Front-End Web Programming Example

## Learning Goals

- Define web programming
- Identify the â€œThree Pillars of Web Programming"

## Introduction

HTML, CSS and JavaScript are the main tools we use to build the web. To imagine
how they all work together, think about the web as a robot. HTML is the robot's
structure, CSS is the paint on the robot, plus how its pieces are positioned,
and JavaScript is what actually makes the robot move. So if we want to build web
applications that accept, change and return information (in other words, make
the robot _move_), we'll need understand the Document Object Model (DOM), the
JavaScript language and the principles of web programming.

### Define Web Programming

Web programming, in the most general sense, is how we markup and code web sites
and web applications. Usually when we talk specifically about web programming,
we are focusing on the part where we are working with data in some way: taking
it in, pushing it out, saving, changing or deleting it. For this, we need a
programming language. JavaScript is the language designed to work on the front-
end, or user-facing part, of the web.

While this might be your first introduction to web programming as a programmer,
you've probably experienced plenty of web interactions that someone else
programmed for you. For example, have you ever "favorited" a post on social
media? Chances are that interaction went something like this:

1. You click an empty heart next to a social media post that you like.
2. You see the heart become fully red to indicate your appreciation.

If all goes as it should, the entire process only takes a second or two. But
there are a few other steps going on behind the scenes to make that heart red.
Let's take a closer look at those steps.

### Identify the "Three Pillars of Web Programming"

We can break down web programming into three essential "pillars":

  - Manipulating the DOM
  - Recognizing JS events
  - Communication with the server

Using our "favoriting" example, here's how those pillars translate to our steps:

1. Your click action on the empty heart triggers a JavaScript event.
2. JavaScript sends a notification to the server.
3. After a successful post to the server, the event updates the DOM with a full heart.

Now you know what's going on when you click that heart! The next step is to look
at the code that makes that happen.

## Conclusion

Web programming is how we build ways of information input and output for the
web. We can break down web programming into three pillars that involve working
with the DOM, JavaScript eventing and communication with the server. Now that
we've seen how these elements are connected in principle, we can now move on to
seeing how they work together in practice.
