# Intro to Front-End Web Programming

## Learning Goals

- Define web programming
- Identify the "Three Pillars of Web Programming"
- Recognize web programming in an example

## Introduction

The phrase "Front-End Web Programming" is used in different ways by different
people. In this lesson we're going to choose a definition of "web
programming" and show an example that demonstrates the different parts of "web programming",
so that we know our objective for the next set of lessons.

### Defining Web Programming

Web programming, at its heart, is:

> * Creating documents with HTML
> * Styling the document's content with CSS
> * Adding action and interactivity with Javascript

When a document has a lot of JavaScript code, the page feels closer to a
computer application, so people call it a "**web application**." There's 
no clear distinction between "web sites" and "web applications" like "When
there's three or more actions it's a web application!". Different people 
draw the boundary differently. More or less, we call a page an "application"
when it feels "rich."

## Example: Favoriting a Social Media Post

While this might be your first introduction to looking at some of your favorite
sites with "web programmer" eyes, you've probably experienced plenty of web
interactions that someone else programmed for you. As you move through the rest
of this material, we're going to use _one, tiny_ interaction as our shared
example.

> **Web Programming Example**: "Favoriting" a social media post.

Regardless of the social media site (Instagram, Pinterest, Facebook, LinkedIn,
Twitter), the interaction goes something like this:

1. The site renders some HTML content that is styled using CSS
2. You see the content and decide to show your approval of it
3. You _click_ some visual element meant to show approval (heart,
   thumbs-up, +1, etc.). For example: <img src="https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/fewpjs/fewpjs-fewp-example/empty.png" alt="Twitter empty heart">
4. The visual element _updates_ (animates, goes from empty to full, jiggles, etc) like:  <img src="https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/fewpjs/fewpjs-fewp-example/full.png" alt="Twitter full heart">
5. Behind the scenes, the application _tells the provider_ that this
   post has gained your approval so that the central provider can store
   this information and use it later (for example, to notify the post 
   author that you liked their post).

If all goes as it should, the entire interaction only takes a second or two. But
even this small interaction demonstrates all the concepts of front end web programming.

### The "Three Pillars of Web Programming"

We can break down web programming into three essential "pillars": 

- **Recognize Events**
- **Manipulate the DOM**
- **Communicate with the Server**

In the steps of the Favoriting a Social Media Post example, we _italicized_  
the characteristic verb in steps 3-5. Each of those words exemplifies the 
activity of one of the "pillars" we must learn in order to make web applications.

  - Step 3 showed "**Recognizing JS events**:" Your _click_ action on the empty heart
    tells JavaScript to do work
  - Step 4 showed "**Manipulating the DOM**:" the work JavaScript was told to
    do was to _update_ the screen to make the heart "look clicked"
  - Step 5 showed "**Communicate with the server**:" the work JavaScript was
    told to do was to _tell the social media company_ that you approved of this
    content

Now you know what's going on when you click that heart! The next lessons will
focus on explaining each of these "pillars" in more detail. After you've worked 
your way through them, your new "web programmer" eyes will have you looking at
your favorite sites very differently.

## Conclusion

Web Programming is creating documents with HTML, styling / positioning the
documents' content with CSS, and updating that content and servers based on
events using JavaScript. We can break down the Javascript part of web 
programming into three pillars that involve working with the DOM, Javascript
eventing and communication with the server. Now that we've seen how these
pillars are connected in the abstract, we are ready to dive in to seeing how they
work together in detail.
